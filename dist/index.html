						<h3>Know God</h2>
						<p>We love modern worship music and great biblical teaching that
							we can apply to our daily lives...and you can expect to find both at CPC during
							our Sunday experiences.
						</p>

						<p>Come as you are. Come expecting God to move. Come ready to see our community forever changed.</p>

						<blockquote>(Matthew 7:21-23) “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven,
							but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day,
							‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many
							miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you.’”
						</blockquote>
					</div>

					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<h3>Find Freedom</h3>
						<p>We believe that life is better together. We were not created to be isolated and
							"do life" on our own. We believe in Life Groups where people can come together, become family, and see
							 God do a work in their lives.
						 </p>

						 <blockquote>
							 (James 5:16) Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
						 </blockquote>
					</div>

					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<h3>Discover Purpose</h3>
						<p>God has an incredible purpose for your life, and the CentrePointe Growth Track is designed to help you connect
							with that purpose. On the Growth Track, you will spend four Sundays diving into what it looks like to follow Jesus,
							connect to the church, discover your purpose and then make a difference with your life.
						</p>

						<ul class="list-unstyled">

							<li>301 Discovery &ndash; understanding our design</li>
							<li>401 Dream Team &ndash; First service opportunity</li>
						</ul>

						<blockquote>
							(Ephesians 4:7-13)
							(Romans 12:6) We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us.
						</blockquote>
					</div>

					<div class="carousel-cell">
						<h3>Make a Difference</h3>
						<p>We want you to be involved with serving...and we have a place for YOU! There is no greater joy to be experienced
							than the joy of making a difference. It’s about people achieving a Glory that outweighs the cares of life. It&lsquo;s
							about doing something eternal.
						</p>

						<blockquote>
							(1 Peter 4:10 NLT) God has given gifts to each of you from his great variety of spiritual gifts. Manage
							them well so that God’s generosity can flow through you.

						<h2 class="heading-left">Leadership</h2>

						<p>For the past 7 years, Zach and Jana Daniels have served in full time ministry with several great churches
							across the United States. During that time, God laid on their heart the desire to plant a church in Zach&lsquo;s
							hometown of Ashland, KY. The decision to finally make the move back to the Bluegrass State didn't happen
							until the summer of 2016.
						</p>

						<p>While there are many churches in the tri-state area of Ashland, KY and surrounding communities, there
							are even more unchurched people. Their passion is not just to create a church where those folks will want
							attend, but where they will connect with God and have a desire to become a devoted follower of Christ.
							A community of believers who believe that Jesus is the hope for the world, where the broken are healed,
							the lost are found, and the captive are set free.
